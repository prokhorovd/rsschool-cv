## Intro:
I started my IT career in 2017, as a system administrator. At the same time, I was trying my hand at web development. I used to make websites as a hobby, you can find examples of my work on my website: [prokhorov.work](https://prokhorov.work).

Now I've decided to switch completely to web development, my goal is to become a full-fledged working unit in the role of a frontend programmer. In 2020 I've become a student again - I chose Software Engineering as my major, also to achieve my goals I signed up for rs-school courses. 

Learning is my main activity now, I plan to reach at least junior level by summer. I don't believe in motivation, but I do believe that hard work brings results and I am willing to put in the effort to learn new skills that will be useful for developer position.

## Skills:
At the moment I have initial level in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have some expirience in Python, Java, C and familiar with git, github, Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.

## Language:
At school and university I studied German, however my reading/listening skill is enough to read professional and fiction literature. Most of the time i have no problem understanding other people, i watch movies mostly in English. 

I used the speaking skill for the last three years when I worked as a sysadmin. Many people in the organization including my boss didn't know Russian so the work tasks had to be discussed and solved in English.
